	},
	{
		question: 'What is the process of screen printing?',
		answer: 'The process of screen printing involves creating a stencil, or "screen" of the design to be printed, which is then placed over the substrate. Ink is then applied to the screen and forced through the mesh onto the substrate using a squeegee. This process can be repeated for multiple colors or layers.'
	},
	{
		question: 'What types of designs are suitable for screen printing?',
		answer: 'Screen printing is best suited for designs with bold, solid colors or simple, graphic shapes. It is less suitable for designs with fine details or complex gradients.'

	{
		question: 'Can I provide my own artwork for screen printing?',
