			"The first step in screen printing is to create the design that will be printed. This design is typically created using graphic design software and is saved as a high-resolution file.",

		title: "Screen Preparation",
		description:
			"Once the design is created, a mesh screen is prepared by coating it with a light-sensitive emulsion. The emulsion is then allowed to dry, and the design is printed onto a transparent film.",

		title: "Exposure",
		description:
			"The printed film is placed on the prepared screen and exposed to a bright light. The light hardens the emulsion on the screen, except for the areas where the design has been printed. These areas remain soft and can be washed away later.",

		description:
			"After exposure, the screen is washed with water, which removes the soft emulsion, leaving the design on the screen.",

		title: "Printing",
		description:
			"The substrate is placed on the printing press, and the screen is placed on top of it. Ink is then poured onto the screen and spread across it using a squeegee. The ink is forced through the mesh and onto the substrate, creating the printed design.",
