    "text": "I had my graduation sash designed and embroidered by Fashion Greek and am really glad that I chose to use them instead of the USC bookstore. In fact, my quote from the USC bookstore was double the price that Fashion Greek quoted me.  James went above and beyond and provided a free consultation meeting in which he planned out exactly what I wanted on my sash, created a mock-up design, and took the time to change the font/layout to make it look better. I later decided that I wanted to add a few extra items to the sash, and the Fashion Greek team sent me a revised mock-up in a very timely fashion and was able to expedite the embroidery process so that the sash would be completed on time. I honestly cannot thank Fashion Greek enough. The sash looks great and I would definitely recommend Fashion Greek to anyone looking for a grad sash. 10/10!"

We were a bit nervous to leave the sash-anything can happen. He told us by Thursday we would have it. Hours later, yes hours, we received a text that it was done! The stitching is perfect! Thank you for the speedy turnaround and fantastic customer service, Fashion Greek and James!!"

    "text": "After trying to design my daughter's graduation stole/sash, I sought professional assistance instead. Schedule your zoom or in-person appt via the link found in the COVID-19 section in their Yelp or from their website. The reminders are fantastic. James is the designer for my daughter's graduation stole/sash. His professional expertise and quick editing skills had me at ease and proud of the upcoming result. Tips before your appt:- \"Class of 202- \" and \"USC\" with shield is standard- Bring a list of desired titles, affiliations, honors, college(s), degree(s), logos, seals, quotes, full name of graduate, etc. Easier to delete or edit down, than forgetting a detail.- Talk with your designer on balancing each side on how it looks overall. We placed the USC seal to balance a side. - Turnaround time is 3-4 weeks. There is a rush fee if needed faster."

    "text": "Graduation is approaching and (much like many others on here) I wanted to get a customised sash. This place came highly recommended by one of my friends so I sent them a quotation and they got back to me pretty quickly, including a quick bit of advice. I decided to book an appointment to discuss the customisation of my sash and the designer James was SO helpful and patient with me when I felt a bit indecisive. He will offer his expert opinion if asked but will ultimately defer to the person's decision, and I really appreciated the little nudges I got regarding certain design choices I'd made because the overall design looked even better after his edits. I'd highly recommend Fashion Greek USC for anyone who's looking to customise their sash, and I'm definitely recommending this store to all my friends! I can't wait to get my sash for graduation!(also they have much nicer color options for sashes instead of just the bright red sash from the USC Bookstore which clashes badly with my skin. I really liked the dark satin option that they have!)A big plus is that you won't have to pay the entire amount of your sash upfront; you can pay a 50% deposit and pay the remaining 50% upon collection. This was a wonderful option!"

I received my sash one week away from taking my graduation photos and I was nervous I'd have to remove the messed up embroidery myself. However, when I walked in to Fashion Greek the employees were more than willing to help me with my problem. They were able to rush order my sash to get it fixed on time for my grad photos at the end of the week. What gives this place a 6/5 stars is the fact that they actually ended up getting my sash fixed in two days rather than taking the whole week to finish it. Give this place your business, you won't regret it!"

There where many options but they seemed to be limited in many aspects. One company was overcharging me and the shirt was low quality, however I remembered in the past one time I had used fashion Greek and that purchase very spectacular. Boy was I glad I choose them!!! This is my second purchase with them it awesome.Important note: I love how they ask questions of what my order was about and how they executed their communication skills!I love how they sell trusted brand name shirts such as Bella canvas (it's cotton ring spun, a great source of quality in the market- soft feel and look - also durable).Also an employee by the name of Khim did a phenomenal job, I'm very big on communication and she made sure to go over the work with and I absolutely LOVE it and how well she worked with me. She adjusted my logo in the right spacing and aligned it just how I had in mind, she was impeccable and made my experience stress free.Make sure your order and shirt is aligned properly to avoid conflicts including width & height :) They also have a shipping option which I think is super helpful, if you're not in a rush get it shipped. It so cool receiving stuff during quarantine. It's saves you gas and time also it's very affordable shipping!!!!The owner Mark did such a fantastic job, for quality assurance he called me and went above and beyond to make sure my order experience was nothing less than great.In my most honest opinion the team here does a wonderful job!!! I appreciate the fact that Khim wasn't annoyed making adjustments to my order prior to shipping, she was patient and understood how important my order was to me. Especially over the fact that in this order: I was ordering for my cleaning company. I'm so happy with the results! The shirt quality is great, the printing quality is awesome and the customer services was the cherry on top!!! I'm excited to do business in the further here. Thanks everyone once again, I appreciate your hard work!!"
